## About me

In the 80th my parents bought an Amiga 500 for my brother and me (round about 1985). This was the start in the new area of IT. In this time I did my first try to write some small programs in an Basic program language. Drawing some lines, creating some menus and do some input and output. That was all in the beginning. But I never lost the fun of IT and development.
